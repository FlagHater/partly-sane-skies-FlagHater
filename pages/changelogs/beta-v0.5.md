## New
 + Mods Checker (@hannibal002 and @Su386yt)
   - Checks your mods to find outdated, unknown and suspicious mods in your mod folder.
   - **This only works if we have the data for all official mods, so if you believe a mod is being falsely flagged as unknown, please report it in the PSS discord!**
