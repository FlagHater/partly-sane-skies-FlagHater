## Changes
### Custom Auction House Menu Revamp (@Su386yt)

After a ton of comments, Reddit posts, and Forum posts of people complaining how horrifying our custom auction house was, we decided to make it slightly less horrifying. We've remade it and made a few changes:

- **By default, the auction house is now smaller**
- By default, the FurfSky Textures are used
- The BIN sniper highlighting is more visible, 
- The BIN sniper now supports a chroma accent color
- The BIN sniper highlighting is now rounded
- The Auction House shouldn't crash anymore (theoretically)
- **Nearly every aspect is customisable**
